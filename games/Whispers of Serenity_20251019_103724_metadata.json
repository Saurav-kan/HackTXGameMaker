A 'Serenity Score' is calculated based on overall stealth and minimal detection. Bonus points for completing levels without taking any damage.",

    "sound_theme": "Ambient, atmospheric soundtrack featuring traditional East Asian instruments like the Koto, Shakuhachi, and various percussions. Sound effects are subtle and reactive, emphasizing the player's stealth. Enemy sounds are dissonant and unsettling, contrasting with the serene environment."
