    "title": "Prismatic Dash: Sakura Bloom",
    "description": "A vibrant top-down 2D platformer where players control a nimble geometric entity, navigating challenging, procedurally generated levels filled with geometric obstacles and delightful pink hues. Master precise movements and timed jumps to reach the end of each stage and uncover the secrets of the Sakura Bloom.",
    "genre": "Platformer / Rhythm",
    "theme": "Geometric, Pink Aesthetic, Sakura Bloom, Abstract",
    "objective": "Reach the end of each procedurally generated level, collecting 'Bloom Essences' and achieving high scores. The ultimate goal is to fully blossom the giant Sakura tree at the end of the game.",
    "mechanics": [
      "Precise directional movement and jumping on geometric platforms.",
      "Timed interactions with moving and rotating geometric hazards.",
      "Rhythm-based platforming: platforms and hazards often sync with a subtle, driving beat.",
      "Procedural level generation with increasing complexity and new geometric patterns."
    ],
    "player_abilities": [
      "Basic Jump: A standard jump that can be held for higher elevation.",
      "Dash: A quick horizontal burst of speed, used to cross gaps or dodge obstacles. Can be performed mid-air.",
      "Bloom Burst (Limited Use): A short-range upward burst of energy that can briefly stun enemies and activate certain environmental elements."

      {
        "name": "Prism Sentinel",
        "behavior": "A larger, square enemy that rotates slowly.  It has a small 'danger zone' around its edges. Touching it or its danger zone resets the player.",
        "difficulty": "medium"
      },
      {
        "name": "Kaleido-Crawler",
        "behavior": "A line of interconnected circles that moves along predefined paths, often appearing from off-screen.  Touching any part of the line resets the player.",
        "difficulty": "medium"
      },
      {
        "name": "Echo Orb",
        "behavior": "A spherical enemy that emits a short-range pulse every few seconds.  The pulse briefly makes platforms intangible.  Timing is crucial to avoid falling through.",

      {
        "name": "Bloom Essence",

      },
      {
        "name": "Tempo Boost",
        "effect": "Temporarily slows down all hazards and enemies, making it easier to navigate difficult sections.  Lasts for a short duration."
      }
    ],
    "level_progression": "Levels are procedurally generated in themed 'districts' (e.g., 'Crystal Gardens', 'Nebula Nook', 'Roseate Ruins'). Each district introduces new geometric shapes, hazard patterns, and increasing difficulty.  Completing a district unlocks the next.",
    "scoring_system": "Points are awarded for: collecting Bloom Essences, completing levels quickly, performing extended combos of dashes and jumps, and surviving without falling or hitting enemies.  A multiplier increases with consecutive successful maneuvers.",
    "visual_style": "Clean, solid-color geometric sprites.  A palette dominated by various shades of pink, magenta, and complementary soft pastels.  Backgrounds are abstract geometric patterns that subtly shift and pulsate.  No textures or photographic elements.",
    "sound_theme": "Uplifting and energetic electronic music with a subtle, driving beat that often syncs with level mechanics.  Sound effects are clean and synthesized, complementing the geometric aesthetic (e.g., 'pop' for jumps, 'whizz' for dashes, 'chime' for collecting Essences)."
