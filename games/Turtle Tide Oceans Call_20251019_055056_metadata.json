    "theme": "Sunny Beach & Ocean, Natural Wildlife, Cute Cartoon",
    "objective": "Safely guide all baby turtles from their inland nest across a busy beach, avoiding natural hazards and predators, to the safety of the open ocean.",
    "mechanics": [
      "**Path Drawing:** The player 'draws' a temporary path on the sand for a group of turtles to follow using the mouse or touch. Turtles will slowly move along this path until they reach the end or a new path is drawn.",
      "**Obstacle Clearing:** Click on small environmental obstacles (e.g., fallen coconuts, seaweed clumps, small rocks) to temporarily clear or move them, opening a path for the turtles. This action might have a short cooldown or consume a limited resource.",
      "**Predator Distraction:** Click near a predator to create a temporary sound or visual distraction (e.g., a splash, a quick digging motion), causing the predator to briefly investigate or move away from the turtles. This also has a cooldown."
    ],
    "player_abilities": [
      "**Weave Path:** Draw a safe route for the turtles to follow, avoiding dangers.",

        "name": "Hungry Seagull",

      {
        "name": "Pesky Crab",
        "behavior": "Scuttles across the sand, often blocking common paths or moving erratically. If a turtle gets too close, it will attempt to nip. Can be scared off temporarily by a distraction or by drawing a path around it.",
        "difficulty": "easy"
      },
      {
        "name": "Curious Raccoon",
        "behavior": "Appears in later levels or specific environmental zones (e.g., near dunes). Moves slowly but purposefully towards the turtle group. More resilient to distractions, requiring multiple clicks or a more persistent diversion to deter.",

    "powerups": [
      {
        "name": "Speedy Sand",
        "effect": "For a short duration (e.g., 5-7 seconds), all currently guided turtles gain a significant burst of movement speed, allowing them to cross dangerous zones quickly."
      },
      {
        "name": "Guardian Aura",
        "effect": "A temporary glowing shield surrounds the group of turtles, making them immune to one predator attack or allowing them to pass through a minor environmental hazard (e.g., a small patch of stinging seaweed) without harm for a few seconds."
      }
    ],
    "level_progression": "The game consists of short, distinct levels, each representing a unique section of the beach. Levels progressively introduce new types of obstacles, more complex predator patrol patterns, and longer, more winding paths to the ocean. New environmental mechanics (e.g., quicksand patches, strong tide pools that push turtles) are introduced gradually. The overall objective for each level is to successfully guide a minimum number of turtles (e.g., 8 out of 10) to the safety of the ocean waves to advance.",
    "scoring_system": "Points are awarded at the end of each level based on several factors: \n1.  **Turtles Saved:** Base points for each turtle successfully reaching the ocean.\n2.  **Time Bonus:** Additional points based on the amount of time remaining when the level objective is met.\n3.  **Efficiency Bonus:** Fewer uses of obstacle clearing and predator distraction abilities earn bonus points.\n4.  **Perfect Run Bonus:** A significant bonus is awarded for saving ALL starting turtles in a level.",
    "visual_style": "Cute, vibrant, and highly stylized 2D art. Utilizing a top-down perspective with a slight isometric tilt to add a sense of depth to the beach environment. Characters (turtles, predators) are 'chibi' or 'toon-shaded' with clear outlines. The color palette is bright and inviting, dominated by warm sandy yellows, serene ocean blues, lush greens of sparse beach vegetation, and pops of tropical colors.",
    "sound_theme": "A relaxing, whimsical, and immersive audio experience. Ambient sounds like gentle ocean waves, distant seagull cries, and rustling palm leaves create a peaceful background. Playful, 'bubbly' sound effects accompany turtle movement and path drawing. Predator appearances are underscored by a subtle, slightly tense (but still lighthearted) musical sting. Successful turtle saves are celebrated with cheerful chimes and a triumphant, short musical flourish. The main menu and level-select music would be an upbeat, tropical-inspired melody."
