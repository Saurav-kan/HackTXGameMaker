    "title": "Prismatic Pulse",
    "description": "A rhythm-driven, top-down 2D platformer where players guide a luminous orb through vibrant, geometric worlds, avoiding obstacles and collecting echoes of light.",
    "genre": "Rhythm Platformer",
    "theme": "Shimmering Pink Geometry: Imagine a world constructed entirely of solid, pastel pink geometric shapes, pulsating with light and sound. The aesthetic is clean, vibrant, and almost dreamlike.",
    "objective": "Reach the end of each level by skillfully navigating through increasingly complex geometric obstacle courses, synchronized to a driving electronic soundtrack.",
    "mechanics": [
      "Rhythmic Movement: Player movement and actions are directly tied to the beat of the music. Successful timing leads to smoother traversal and higher scores.",
      "Solid Block Interaction: Players can only interact with specific 'glowing' blocks. Other solid blocks act as permanent obstacles or death traps.",
      "Echo Collection: Collect shimmering 'echoes' scattered throughout the levels to increase score and unlock cosmetic customization options."
    ],
    "player_abilities": [
      "Pulse Jump: A short, responsive jump that can be timed with the beat for extra height or to activate certain platforms.",
      "Dash (Timed): A quick horizontal dash that, when performed on beat, provides a brief invincibility frame and momentum boost.",
      "Orbit Shield: A temporary shield that activates upon collecting a special powerup, allowing the player to break through minor obstacles."

        "difficulty": "easy"
      },
      {
        "name": "Resonance Spinner",
        "behavior": "A larger, spinning geometric shape that rotates in time with the music. Its spinning segments can crush the player, and its movement patterns become more erratic as the music intensifies.",
        "difficulty": "medium"
      },
      {
        "name": "Void Shard",
        "behavior": "These sharp, stationary geometric spikes appear and disappear in sync with specific musical cues. Their timing is crucial to avoid, and they can be deadly if the player isn't attentive to the rhythm.",

      {
        "name": "Luminous Anchor",
        "effect": "Creates a temporary safe zone on the screen where the player can reset their position to a designated point if they make a mistake, but this costs points."
      }
    ],
    "level_progression": "Levels are unlocked sequentially. Each level introduces new geometric enemies, more complex rhythmic patterns, and environmental hazards. Difficulty increases through faster music tempo, more intricate obstacle layouts, and tighter timing windows.",
    "scoring_system": "Points are awarded for collected echoes, completing levels quickly, performing on-beat abilities (dash, jump), and maintaining combo streaks. Missed beats or collisions with hazards reset combo streaks and can subtract points.",
    "visual_style": "Clean, vector-based 2D graphics. Predominantly pastel pinks, purples, and light blues with subtle gradients and glowing effects. Geometric shapes are sharp and well-defined. Animations are fluid and synchronized with the music.",
    "sound_theme": "Upbeat, melodic electronic music with a strong, driving beat. Each level's soundtrack is composed to be an integral part of the gameplay, with distinct musical cues that correspond to environmental changes and obstacle patterns."
