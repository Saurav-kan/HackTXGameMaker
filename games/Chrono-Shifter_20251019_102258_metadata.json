    "description": "A fast-paced reaction game where players must precisely time their 'shift' action to match the changing sprite of their character, navigating through increasingly chaotic timelines.",
    "genre": "Reaction",
    "theme": "Time-bending, digital glitch, abstract",
    "objective": "Survive as long as possible by successfully shifting your sprite to match the target sprite, accumulating a high score.",
    "mechanics": [
      "Sprite matching: The player's sprite will randomly cycle through a set of predetermined appearances. The player must press the spacebar when their sprite matches the current 'target' sprite.",
      "Reaction timing: Success is determined by the accuracy of the spacebar press within a small window of opportunity when the sprites align.",
      "Increasing complexity: As the game progresses, the speed of sprite changes increases, and the number of possible sprite variations may also grow."
    ],
    "player_abilities": [
      "Shift: The primary action, pressing spacebar to attempt to lock your current sprite form.",
      "Focus (Unlockable): Temporarily slows down the sprite change rate, allowing for more precise timing.",
      "Rewind (Unlockable): Undoes the last incorrect shift, giving a second chance."

        "effect": "Awards bonus points for a streak of perfectly timed shifts."
      }
    ],
    "level_progression": "Levels are defined by score thresholds. As the player achieves higher scores, the game speed increases, new enemy types are introduced, and the sprite variation pool may expand. Each 'level' is essentially a new speed tier.",
    "scoring_system": "Points are awarded for each successful sprite match. Bonus points are awarded for consecutive successful matches (streaks) and for perfect timing (pressing spacebar within a very tight window). Incorrect shifts result in a score penalty or a game over.",
    "visual_style": "Clean, minimalist, and abstract. Character sprites are simple geometric shapes or stylized icons that can easily transform between distinct forms. Backgrounds are dynamic and reactive, perhaps featuring shifting gradients, particle effects, or abstract geometric patterns that subtly complement the theme of time and digital alteration. Think neon outlines, glowing elements, and a sense of energetic flow.",
    "sound_theme": "Electronic, pulsing, and minimalist. Sound effects are sharp and satisfying for successful shifts (e.g., a 'snap' or 'click') and jarring or dissonant for misses. Background music is an evolving ambient electronic track that builds in intensity and complexity as the game speed increases, incorporating glitchy textures and rhythmic elements that echo the gameplay."
