    "description": "A celestial re-imagining of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe, where players battle for dominance across the cosmos by strategically placing stars and nebulae on a grid of constellations.",
    "genre": "Puzzle",
    "theme": "Cosmic, Sci-Fi, Celestial",
    "objective": "To be the first player (or AI) to achieve three of their celestial symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, on a cosmic game board.",
    "mechanics": [
      "Grid-based placement: Players take turns selecting an empty space on the 3x3 cosmic grid to place their celestial symbol.",
      "Symbol selection: Players choose between placing a 'Star' (X) or a 'Nebula' (O) on their turn.",
      "Win condition check: After each placement, the game checks if the current player has achieved three of their symbols in a row."
    ],
    "player_abilities": [
      "Strategic placement: The primary ability is to choose the most advantageous square to place a symbol, aiming for winning lines and blocking opponents.",
      "Symbol choice: The player can decide whether to place a Star or a Nebula, which can be a strategic choice based on the board state (though in a standard Tic-Tac-Toe, this choice is fixed per player).",
      "AI opponent: For single-player, the player can engage with an AI opponent of varying difficulty levels."

        "effect": "Forces a re-roll of the opponent's next move (AI might pick a different random spot or re-evaluate strategy)."
      }
    ],
    "level_progression": "The game can progress through different 'Galactic Arenas' which are simply cosmetic variations of the 3x3 grid. Each arena could represent a different nebula or star cluster. Difficulty can be increased by facing tougher AI opponents.",
    "scoring_system": "Points are awarded for winning a match (e.g., 100 points). Ties (draws) can award a smaller amount (e.g., 25 points). Bonus points can be awarded for winning quickly or with a specific type of win (e.g., diagonal).",
    "visual_style": "A vibrant, topdown 2D aesthetic with deep space backgrounds. The game board is a stylized representation of a constellation. Player symbols are glowing stars (X) and swirling nebulae (O). Animations should be subtle and ethereal, with particles and light effects. UI elements are sleek and sci-fi inspired.",
    "sound_theme": "Ambient, atmospheric electronic music with subtle chimes and ethereal synth pads that evoke the vastness of space. Sound effects should be crisp and satisfying, like the gentle hum of a star igniting or the soft swirl of a nebula when placing a symbol. Victory sounds are triumphant and celestial."
