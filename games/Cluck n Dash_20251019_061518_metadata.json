    "title": "Cluck 'n' Dash",
    "description": "A simple yet chaotic top-down 2D game where players must guide a brave chicken across a procedurally generated road filled with unpredictable traffic and helpful, or not-so-helpful, farm animals. It's all about timing, reflexes, and embracing the absurdity of poultry road-crossing.",
    "genre": "Arcade",
    "theme": "Whimsical Farm & Road Hazard",
    "objective": "Successfully guide the chicken across the road to reach the safety of the farm on the other side, one road at a time.",
    "mechanics": [
      "Tap/Click to move the chicken in the desired direction (up, down, left, right).",
      "Momentum-based movement: Chicken continues in its chosen direction for a short burst, requiring predictive input.",
      "Lane-based navigation: Players must strategically choose lanes to avoid oncoming vehicles."
    ],
    "player_abilities": [
      "Dash (limited use): A quick burst of speed to evade immediate danger.",
      "Peck (passive): A very small chance to briefly stun a slow-moving vehicle (rarely useful, mostly for comedic effect).",
      "Cluck (sound cue): Emits a distinct cluck that briefly draws the attention of nearby animals (can be used to lure or distract)."

    "enemies": [
      {

        "name": "Slow-moving Tractor",

        "name": "Rogue Pig",

        "effect": "Restores one use of the Dash ability."

        "name": "Lucky Clover",
        "effect": "Makes the chicken momentarily invincible, passing through any vehicle or animal without harm."
      }
    ],
    "level_progression": "Levels increase in difficulty by introducing more vehicles, faster traffic, more complex lane patterns, and new enemy types. Each 'level' is essentially crossing a new segment of the road, with a 'goal' area representing successful passage to the next segment.",
    "scoring_system": "Points are awarded for each successful crossing of a road segment. Bonus points are given for collecting powerups, using the dash ability effectively to avoid collisions, and for performing 'cluck' distractions that lead to near-misses. A multiplier increases for consecutive successful crossings without a 'splat'.",
    "visual_style": "Bright, cartoony, and slightly exaggerated. Think flat design with bold outlines and vibrant colors. The chicken should be a clear, easily identifiable sprite. Vehicles are simple, recognizable shapes with distinct color palettes. Backgrounds are cheerful and reminiscent of a rural farm setting.",
    "sound_theme": "Uplifting and quirky. A catchy, looping bluegrass or country-inspired soundtrack. Sound effects are punchy and comical: 'clucks', 'squawks', distinct vehicle horns and engine sounds, comical 'splat' noises (muted and not overly graphic), and satisfying 'ding' sounds for powerups and successful crossings."
