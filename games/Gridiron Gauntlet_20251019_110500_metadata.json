    "title": "Gridiron Gauntlet",
    "description": "A high-octane, top-down 2D arcade game where you play as a star running back, battling through the entire opposing team to reach the endzone against all odds. Think of it as an endless runner meets a football frenzy.",
    "genre": "Arcade, Action, Sports",
    "theme": "Energetic, vibrant American football stadium atmosphere with a slightly stylized, almost comic-book-esque visual flair.",
    "objective": "Reach the endzone in each increasingly challenging level, accumulating the highest score possible by evading tackles, collecting items, and performing skillful maneuvers.",
    "mechanics": [
      "Directional Movement & Dodging: Players control the running back's movement using directional inputs. Quick taps or swipes in a direction initiate evasive dodges.",
      "Stamina Management: Performing special moves and continuous sprinting depletes stamina, requiring strategic breaks and powerup usage.",
      "Tackle Avoidance: The core mechanic involves predicting enemy defender movements and using dodges, jukes, and speed bursts to avoid being tackled."
    ],
    "player_abilities": [
      "Sprint Burst: A temporary, significant increase in speed, draining stamina rapidly.",
      "Juke Move: A quick, lateral dodge that can throw off pursuing defenders. Has a short cooldown.",
      "Spin Move: A circular evasive maneuver that can disorient and temporarily stun nearby defenders, opening up pathways."

      {
        "name": "Linebacker",

      },
      {
        "name": "Cornerback",
        "behavior": "Slightly faster than Linebackers, often starts further downfield, attempts to cut off routes with diagonal movements.",
        "difficulty": "medium"
      },
      {
        "name": "Safety",
        "behavior": "The most challenging, covers the deepest parts of the field, has the longest 'sightline', and will sprint to close distance quickly.",

      {
        "name": "Speed Boost",
        "effect": "Temporarily increases player speed significantly, without draining stamina for the duration."
      }
    ],
    "level_progression": "Each 'level' represents a new down or drive. Levels increase in difficulty by introducing more defenders, faster enemy speeds, and more complex defensive formations. The game can also feature 'endless mode' with procedurally generated field layouts.",
    "scoring_system": "Points are awarded for: reaching the endzone (major points), evading tackles (minor points per evasion), collecting 'coins' or 'stars' scattered on the field, and achieving combos for consecutive evasions without being tackled.",
    "visual_style": "A vibrant, cartoonish 2D art style with bold outlines, exaggerated player animations, and a dynamic camera that slightly zooms and pans to emphasize the action. Fields will be richly detailed with cheering crowds and stadium lights.",
    "sound_theme": "Upbeat, energetic funk or rock soundtrack with dynamic tempo changes that ramp up during intense moments. Satisfying 'swish' sounds for jukes, impactful 'thuds' for near tackles, and distinct audio cues for powerups and defender alerts."
