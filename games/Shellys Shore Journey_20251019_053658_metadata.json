    "title": "Shelly's Shore Journey",
    "description": "Guide Shelly, a determined little sea turtle hatchling, on her perilous journey from her sandy nest to the welcoming embrace of the ocean. Navigate a vibrant beach filled with natural obstacles and hungry predators in this heartwarming top-down 2D action-puzzle game.",
    "genre": "Action-Puzzle / Casual Arcade",
    "theme": "Vibrant, sun-drenched beach with a focus on cute wildlife, natural elements, and a heartwarming struggle for survival.",
    "objective": "Guide Shelly from her inland nest to the ocean's edge at the bottom of the screen, avoiding all hazards and reaching the water within a given time limit.",
    "mechanics": [
      "**Top-down Movement**: Control Shelly's crawl using directional inputs, finding optimal paths through the environment.",
      "**Obstacle Navigation**: Identify and maneuver around environmental obstacles such as rocks, driftwood, shallow puddles, and tall grass.",
      "**Predator Evasion**: Observe enemy patrol patterns and behaviors to time movements and avoid being caught or damaged.",
      "**Light Environmental Interaction**: Push small, light objects (like shells or tiny coconuts) to clear paths or create temporary diversions."
    ],
    "player_abilities": [
      "**Basic Crawl**: Shelly's standard movement ability, allowing her to traverse the beach at a steady pace.",
      "**Shell Retreat**: Shelly can briefly pull into her shell, becoming invulnerable to minor damage and stunning small enemies (like crabs) that try to attack her while she's retracted. Has a short cooldown.",
      "**Quick Dash**: A short burst of speed used to quickly cross dangerous zones or escape a chasing enemy. Uses a limited stamina bar that regenerates over time."

    "enemies": [
      {
        "name": "Beach Crab",
        "behavior": "Scuttles back and forth along set patrol paths or guards small areas. If Shelly gets too close, it will quickly charge in a straight line towards her. Can be temporarily stunned by Shell Retreat.",
        "difficulty": "easy"
      },
      {
        "name": "Seagull",
        "behavior": "Flies overhead, casting a visible shadow on the ground. If Shelly stays in the shadow for too long, the seagull will swoop down to snatch her. Requires quick movement out of the shadow or perfectly timed Shell Retreat.",
        "difficulty": "medium"
      },
      {
        "name": "Sun-baked Log",
        "behavior": "A large, immovable environmental obstacle that blocks paths. Can provide momentary shade or cover from flying predators if Shelly hides behind it.",

      },
      {
        "name": "Protective Seaweed",
        "effect": "Grants a temporary protective shimmer, allowing Shelly to take one hit from an enemy without taking damage. The effect wears off after one hit or a short duration."
      },
      {
        "name": "Shiny Starfish",
        "effect": "A collectible item (often slightly off the main path) that adds bonus points to the player's score at the end of the level."
      }
    ],
    "level_progression": "Each level represents a new stretch of beach, increasing in length, complexity, and the number/variety of hazards. New enemy types and environmental puzzles are introduced progressively. Later levels might feature dynamic elements like shifting sands, rising tides, or mini-boss-like encounters with larger, more territorial creatures. The ultimate goal is always to reach the ocean, which becomes increasingly challenging to do.",
    "scoring_system": "Players earn points based on how quickly they complete a level (faster times yield higher bonuses), the number of Shiny Starfish collected, and a 'No Damage' bonus if Shelly reaches the ocean unharmed. High scores are recorded locally and potentially on a global leaderboard.",
    "visual_style": "Charming, hand-drawn 2D pixel art with a vibrant and cheerful color palette. Character designs are cute and expressive, particularly Shelly's animations. Environments feature swaying palm trees, glistening sand textures, sparkling water effects, and dynamic shadows that give a sense of depth and time of day. Animations are fluid and appealing, enhancing the game's inviting atmosphere.",
    "sound_theme": "A calming and ambient soundscape of the beach (gentle waves, distant gulls, rustling wind). The soundtrack is upbeat, whimsical, and slightly adventurous, primarily featuring ukulele, flutes, and light percussion. It subtly picks up tempo during tense predator encounters and returns to a more serene melody during safer moments. Sound effects for Shelly's actions and interactions are cute and playful."
