    "title": "The Monkey's Goal!",
    "description": "A frantic reaction-time game where players must strategically click a red button at the precise moment the on-screen image transforms from a playful monkey to a determined football player. Master the timing, outwit your opponents, and become the ultimate reaction champion!",
    "genre": "Arcade, Reaction, Puzzle",
    "theme": "Whimsical Sports Arena with Jungle Elements",
    "objective": "Click the red button only when the image on screen displays a football player, and *never* when it displays a monkey. Achieve the highest score possible by successfully making correct clicks and avoiding incorrect ones.",
    "mechanics": [
      "Rapid Image Transition: The game rapidly cycles between two distinct sprites: a playful monkey and a football player.",
      "Timed Button Press: Players must press the central red button within a very small time window when the football player sprite is displayed.",
      "Score Multiplier: Consecutive correct clicks increase a score multiplier, rewarding precision and consistency.",
      "Failure Penalty: Incorrect clicks (pressing for the monkey) or failing to press for the football player result in a score penalty and a loss of multiplier progress."
    ],
    "player_abilities": [
      "Focus: Temporarily slows down the image transition speed, allowing for more precise timing.",
      "Insight: Briefly highlights the target sprite (football player) with a subtle glow, reducing visual confusion.",
      "Quick Reflex: Grants a short burst of immunity to penalties for one incorrect click."

      {
        "name": "Goalie Glitch",
        "behavior": "Introduces subtle visual distortions or brief 'flickers' between the monkey and football player, designed to trick the player's perception.",

        "effect": "Expands the active click window for a few seconds, making it easier to get a correct click."
      }
    ],
    "level_progression": "Levels increase in difficulty by accelerating the speed of image transitions, introducing more challenging enemy behaviors, and decreasing the duration of powerup effects.  Each level might also introduce a new enemy or a variation of an existing one.",
    "scoring_system": "Points are awarded for each correct click on the football player.  Consecutive correct clicks build a score multiplier (e.g., 1x, 2x, 3x). Incorrect clicks reduce the multiplier and deduct points.  Bonus points are awarded for completing levels without any incorrect clicks.",
    "visual_style": "Vibrant, cartoonish 2D art style with exaggerated animations. The background is a lively stadium, perhaps with jungle-themed elements like vines and palm trees incorporated into the arena. Sprites are clear and distinct, with the monkey being playful and energetic, and the football player being dynamic and ready for action. The red button should be large and satisfying to click.",
    "sound_theme": "Upbeat and energetic electronic music with a quirky, stadium-like feel. Sound effects are punchy and responsive: a satisfying 'ding!' for a correct click, a comical 'boing!' for an incorrect click, energetic jungle-themed ambient sounds, and distinct audio cues for enemy attacks and powerup activations."
