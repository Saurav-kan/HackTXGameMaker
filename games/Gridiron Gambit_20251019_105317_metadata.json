    "mechanics": [
      "Movement: Agile top-down movement using directional controls to evade defenders.",
      "Tackling System: Enemies will attempt to tackle the player. Players must use evasive maneuvers to avoid contact.",
      "Stamina Management: Sprinting and special moves consume stamina, requiring strategic use of energy."

    "player_abilities": [
      "Juke Move: A quick burst of lateral movement to shake off a defender.",
      "Stiff Arm: A short-range shove to create space or break free from a tackle.",

    "level_progression": "Levels progress by increasing the complexity of the field layout, the number and types of defensive players, and introducing environmental hazards (e.g., slippery patches, wind gusts that affect ball trajectory if passing is added). Each level represents a new drive or a more challenging defensive formation.",
    "scoring_system": "Primarily through scoring touchdowns. Bonus points can be awarded for long runs, breaking multiple tackles in a single play, or completing specific challenges within a level (e.g., scoring without losing any stamina).",
    "visual_style": "Vibrant, slightly cartoony 2D graphics with clear player sprites, distinct defensive player designs, and detailed field environments. Smooth animations for player movements and tackles.",
    "sound_theme": "Upbeat, energetic soundtrack with classic arcade-style chiptune elements. Satisfying sound effects for tackles, jukes, sprints, and scoring touchdowns. Crowd cheers and announcer snippets to enhance the game atmosphere."
