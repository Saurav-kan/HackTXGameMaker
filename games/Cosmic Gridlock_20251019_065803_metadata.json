    "description": "Engage in a strategic battle of wits across the cosmos in this electrifying 2D top-down Tic-Tac-Toe experience. Players take on the role of celestial entities vying for dominance on a grid woven from starlight.",
    "genre": "Puzzle",
    "theme": "Retro-futuristic cosmic",
    "objective": "To strategically place your celestial markers (Orbs of Light or Void Stars) on the cosmic grid to form a line of three in any direction (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) before your opponent does.",
    "mechanics": [
      "Turn-based gameplay: Players alternate placing their markers on empty spaces within the 3x3 cosmic grid.",
      "Strategic placement: Players must anticipate opponent moves and plan their own placements to achieve victory or block an opponent's win.",
      "Line formation: The primary goal is to create a line of three of your own markers."
    ],
    "player_abilities": [
      "Place Marker: The fundamental ability to place your chosen marker on an available grid space.",
      "Special Move (Limited Use): Once per game, the player can unleash a 'Warp Shift' allowing them to swap the positions of two of their own markers already on the board.",
      "Strategic Foresight (AI Opponent Only): The AI opponent will analyze potential winning lines for both itself and the player."

        "behavior": "Attempts to form its own winning lines while actively blocking the player's attempts. Its difficulty can be scaled.",

        "name": "Cosmic Reversal",
        "effect": "Allows the player to take back their last move, offering a second chance at strategic placement."
      }
    ],
    "level_progression": "The game progresses through a series of increasingly challenging AI opponents, each with slightly different strategic tendencies and potentially unique visual themes for their respective cosmic grids. For example, Level 1 might be a serene starry night, Level 2 a swirling nebula, and Level 3 a black hole backdrop.",
    "scoring_system": "Points are awarded for winning a match. Additional bonus points can be awarded for winning with a 'perfect' game (opponent never comes close to winning), or for winning using the 'Warp Shift' ability. A loss results in a point deduction.",
    "visual_style": "A vibrant, retro-futuristic aesthetic. The grid itself is composed of glowing starlight and nebulae. Markers could be pulsating orbs of light (player) and shadowy, swirling voids (AI). Backgrounds feature dynamic cosmic vistas with slowly moving celestial bodies. UI elements are sleek and holographic.",
    "sound_theme": "A synth-heavy, ambient soundtrack reminiscent of classic space exploration films. Sound effects are crisp and futuristic, with subtle hums for marker placement, a satisfying 'whoosh' for the Warp Shift, and a triumphant fanfare for victory."
