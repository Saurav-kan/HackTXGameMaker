    "description": "A fast-paced, top-down 2D arena brawler where players master the ancient art of Rock Paper Scissors in a time-bending, ever-evolving combat zone.",
    "genre": "Action / Fighting / Party",
    "theme": "Futuristic Neon Arena with Temporal Anomalies",
    "objective": "Defeat all opponents in the arena by strategically predicting and countering their moves in a series of Rock Paper Scissors rounds, while navigating environmental hazards and power-ups.",
    "mechanics": [
      "Real-time Rock Paper Scissors: Players select Rock, Paper, or Scissors simultaneously each round. The outcome is determined by the classic rules (Rock crushes Scissors, Scissors cuts Paper, Paper covers Rock).",
      "Arena Movement: Players navigate a top-down arena, dodging attacks, positioning themselves, and collecting power-ups.",
      "Temporal Distortions: The arena periodically glitches, introducing temporary effects like slowed time, speed bursts, or random move swaps, adding an element of chaos.",
      "Combo System: Successfully winning consecutive rounds without losing builds a combo meter, increasing damage or granting temporary invincibility."

    "player_abilities": [
      "Dash: A quick burst of speed to evade attacks or close distance.",
      "Shield: A temporary defensive barrier that can block one incoming attack (regardless of type).",
      "Predictive Scan: A brief glimpse into the opponent's potential next move (high cooldown, reveals a probability).",
      "Special Move (Unlocked via Combo Meter): A powerful, unique attack tied to a specific RPS choice that won a combo streak."

    "level_progression": "Players advance through a series of increasingly challenging arenas, facing more difficult enemy types and more complex temporal anomaly patterns. Each arena might have unique environmental hazards. Boss levels could feature a single, powerful Chrono-Master with unique attack phases.",
    "scoring_system": "Points are awarded for defeating opponents, winning consecutive rounds (combos), collecting power-ups, and surviving temporal anomalies. Bonus points are awarded for perfectly clean wins (defeating an opponent without losing a single round).",
    "visual_style": "Vibrant, futuristic neon aesthetic. Clean, geometric character designs for players and enemies. The arena itself is a glowing, metallic structure with dynamic lighting. Temporal anomalies are visualized with glitch effects, color shifts, and particle trails.",
    "sound_theme": "Energetic, synthwave-infused soundtrack with pulsing beats. Distinct sound effects for each RPS choice (e.g., a metallic clang for Rock, a sharp cut for Scissors, a swoosh for Paper). Futuristic UI sounds and dramatic cues for temporal anomalies and special moves."
