    "genre": "Puzzle",
    "theme": "Retro Sci-Fi meets Abstract Cosmic",
    "objective": "To win rounds of Tic-Tac-Toe by completing a line of three of your symbols (stars or galaxies) before the opponent does, while simultaneously fending off encroaching alien threats.",
    "mechanics": [
      "Grid-based placement: Players place their symbols on a 3x3 grid.",
      "Symbol switching: Players can choose to play as 'Stars' (X) or 'Galaxies' (O) before each round, influencing their symbol and potential power-up effects.",

        "name": "Comet Raider",

    "scoring_system": "Points are awarded for winning a round of Tic-Tac-Toe. Bonus points are given for winning with a 'clean sweep' (no alien interference on the winning line), or for successfully utilizing power-ups. Losing a round to an alien interference incurs a penalty.",
    "visual_style": "A blend of vibrant, abstract cosmic backgrounds with sharp, retro-futuristic UI elements. Grid lines are represented by glowing energy pathways. Player symbols (stars and galaxies) are stylized and animated. Alien ships are reminiscent of classic arcade invaders with a cosmic flair.",
    "sound_theme": "A dynamic soundtrack that shifts between ambient, ethereal cosmic tunes during calm moments and upbeat, retro-synthwave tracks during intense alien encounters. Sound effects are crisp and futuristic, with satisfying clicks for symbol placement and impactful explosions for alien destruction."
