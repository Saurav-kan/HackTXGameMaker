    "description": "A fast-paced, top-down 2D arcade football game where you, a lone running back, must outmaneuver two relentless defenders to reach the endzone. Master jukes, speed bursts, and strategic dodges to achieve gridiron glory!",
    "genre": "Action / Sports Arcade",
    "theme": "Vibrant, stylized American football stadium with a slightly retro arcade feel.",
    "objective": "Successfully carry the football into the opponent's endzone before being tackled by the two designated defenders.",
    "mechanics": [
      "Player movement and control (WASD or arrow keys for movement, spacebar for sprint/boost).",
      "Dodge/Juke system: Quick directional inputs while moving to evade tackles.",
      "Tackle detection: Defenders will attempt to tackle the player if they get too close and the player isn't actively dodging."

    "player_abilities": [
      "Sprint/Speed Burst: Temporarily increases player speed for quick escapes or closing distance.",
      "Juke Move: A rapid directional change to fake out defenders and make them miss tackles.",
      "Stumble Recovery: A brief period of invincibility after a successful juke or if the player is bumped but not tackled, allowing for quick recovery."

    "enemies": [

        "name": "The Pursuer",

        "name": "The Flanker",

    ],
    "level_progression": "Levels are designed as increasingly difficult courses with varying field layouts, obstacles (like cones or other non-tackling players), and defender spawn points. Each successful touchdown progresses the player to a new, more challenging field.",
    "scoring_system": "Each successful touchdown awards 6 points. Additionally, collecting bonus items on the field (e.g., coins, extra stamina pickups) grants points that contribute to a high score. The goal is to achieve the highest score by completing multiple touchdowns.",
    "visual_style": "Clean, vibrant 2D pixel art with a slightly chunky, retro aesthetic. Distinct team colors for the player and defenders. Dynamic camera that slightly zooms out when the player sprints and zooms in during close tackle attempts.",
    "sound_theme": "Upbeat, driving 8-bit or chiptune soundtrack that ramps up in intensity during chase sequences. Satisfying 'whoosh' sound for sprints, a sharp 'swerve' for jukes, a solid 'thud' for tackles, and a triumphant fanfare for touchdowns."
