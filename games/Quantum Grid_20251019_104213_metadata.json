    "mechanics": [
      "Grid-based movement: Players move their 'Cursor' (representing their mark) across the 3x3 tic-tac-toe grid.",
      "Mark placement: Players can place their mark ('X' or 'O') on an empty grid square their Cursor is currently on.",
      "Power-up activation: Players can collect and activate unique power-ups that alter gameplay.",
      "Turn-based gameplay: Players and AI opponents take turns placing their marks."

      "Cursor Dash: A quick, short-range burst movement to reposition the Cursor.",

        "behavior": "A mobile hazard that periodically moves across empty grid squares, preventing marks from being placed on its current location. It can be temporarily disabled by certain power-ups.",

        "effect": "Allows the player to place two marks in the same turn, on adjacent empty squares."

    "level_progression": "Levels increase in difficulty by introducing more complex AI opponent patterns, faster Warp Drones, and more frequent power-up spawns. Unlockable cosmetic themes for the grid and Cursor.",
    "scoring_system": "Points are awarded for winning a round. Bonus points are given for winning with specific power-ups, achieving a quick win, or preventing the opponent from winning a crucial line. High scores are tracked and displayed.",
    "visual_style": "A clean, neon-infused sci-fi aesthetic. The grid itself can be a pulsating energy field. Cursor and marks have subtle glow effects. Backgrounds feature abstract cosmic nebulae and digital patterns. Top-down perspective with a slight parallax effect for depth.",
    "sound_theme": "An energetic synthwave soundtrack with electronic sound effects. Each action (moving, placing a mark, using a power-up) has distinct, satisfying audio cues. Power-up activations are accompanied by impactful, sci-fi-inspired sounds."
