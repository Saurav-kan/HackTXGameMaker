    "level_progression": "Levels are interconnected zones within the jungle and temple. Players progress by finding new paths, solving puzzles, and defeating mini-bosses that guard key areas. New abilities or power-ups are often unlocked at the end of major sections, opening up previously inaccessible areas (Metroidvania-lite elements).",

    "visual_style": "Hand-drawn 2D art with vibrant, lush jungle environments and detailed, ancient temple ruins.  Character designs are expressive and a bit cartoony, contrasting with the more mysterious aura of the temples.  Parallax scrolling for depth.  Emphasis on dynamic lighting, especially in darker temple areas.",
    "sound_theme": "A blend of calming, ambient jungle sounds (birdsong, rustling leaves, flowing water) that transition into more adventurous and slightly mysterious melodies as Pip enters the ruins.  Satisfying 'whoosh' for vine swings and distinct sound cues for enemy attacks and power-ups."
