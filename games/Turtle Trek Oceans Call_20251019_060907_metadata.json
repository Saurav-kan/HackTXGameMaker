    "title": "Turtle Trek: Ocean's Call",
    "description": "Guide a brave, tiny sea turtle hatchling across a sun-drenched, perilous beach. Dodge scuttling crabs, avoid swooping gulls, and navigate environmental hazards to reach the safety of the vast ocean.",
    "genre": "Casual Arcade / Survival",
    "theme": "Vibrant beach, warm sun, ocean life, nature.",
    "objective": "Guide the turtle hatchling from its nest (top of the screen) to the ocean (bottom of the screen) without getting caught or succumbing to hazards.",
    "mechanics": [
      "Top-down directional movement (8-way) across the beach.",
      "Environmental hazard avoidance (crabs, gulls, waves).",
      "Briefly hiding or 'tucking' into the shell for momentary protection.",
      "Collecting optional beach items for bonus points."
    ],
    "player_abilities": [
      "**Walk**: Standard movement across the sand.",
      "**Tuck & Wait**: Pressing a button makes the turtle briefly pull its head and limbs into its shell, stopping movement but providing a very short burst of minor damage reduction/invincibility to small hits. High risk/reward as it leaves you stationary."

      {
        "name": "Crab Scuttler",
        "behavior": "Patrols small areas horizontally or in tight circles. If the turtle gets too close, it charges quickly in a straight line towards the turtle's last known position for a short distance before returning to patrol. Getting hit causes a brief stun and health loss.",

      },
      {
        "name": "Seagull Swooper",
        "behavior": "Flies in from off-screen, circles overhead, and then swoops down rapidly in an arc to attempt to snatch the turtle. If it misses, it flies off screen. If it hits, it carries the turtle back a short distance, causing damage.",
        "difficulty": "medium"
      },
      {
        "name": "Rogue Wave",
        "behavior": "Not an enemy in the traditional sense, but an environmental hazard. Periodically, a large wave sweeps across the lower portion of the beach (closer to the ocean). If caught, the turtle is pushed back significantly and takes damage.",

      {
        "name": "Energizing Algae",
        "effect": "Briefly increases movement speed for a few seconds, allowing quicker escape from threats or faster progress."
      }
    ],
    "level_progression": "Levels increase in length and complexity. New environmental obstacles (e.g., driftwood logs, tide pools that slow movement) are introduced. The density and variety of enemies/hazards increase, and their patterns become more intricate. Visual changes like different times of day (dawn, midday, sunset) or slight weather variations (overcast) might occur.",
    "scoring_system": "Points are earned for reaching the ocean. A 'Time Bonus' rewards faster completion. 'Survival Bonus' grants points for each segment of health remaining. 'Collectible Bonus' awards points for picking up rare seashells or starfish scattered on the beach, which might be in more dangerous locations.",
    "visual_style": "Cute, vibrant pixel art with a slightly 'chunky' and appealing aesthetic. Bright, warm color palette for the sandy beach, shifting to deep blues and greens for the ocean. Clear, expressive animations for the turtle, enemies, and environmental effects like waves and sand trails.",
    "sound_theme": "Relaxing and atmospheric, featuring gentle wave sounds, distant seagull cries, and subtle, uplifting chiptune melodies that swell during moments of danger. Distinct, light 'plink' sound for collecting items and a soft 'bonk' for minor hits or hazard interactions."
