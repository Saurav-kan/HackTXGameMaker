    "title": "Tic-Tac-Toe Tactics: Gridlock Gauntlet",
    "description": "A fast-paced, top-down 2D arcade game where players strategically place their markers in a dynamic tic-tac-toe grid to outmaneuver AI opponents and conquer increasingly challenging 'Gridlock' arenas.",
    "genre": "Puzzle / Strategy / Arcade",
    "theme": "Modern, minimalist, and energetic. Think clean lines, vibrant neon accents, and a sense of constant motion within a structured environment.",
    "objective": "Win a set number of tic-tac-toe matches against AI opponents within each 'Gridlock' arena before time runs out or the opponent achieves victory.",
    "mechanics": [
      "Dynamic Grid Placement: Players control a cursor to select empty squares on a 3x3 grid and place their designated marker (X or O). The grid itself can have interactive elements.",
      "Grid Manipulation: Certain arenas will feature shifting tiles, rotating sections, or temporary obstacles that alter the available placement options and strategic considerations.",
      "Timed Rounds: Each tic-tac-toe match has a time limit, encouraging quick decision-making and aggressive play. Losing the match or running out of time results in a loss for that round."
    ],
    "player_abilities": [
      "Quick Place: Instantly place a marker in a chosen square, useful for rapid responses.",
      "Marker Swap: Temporarily swap an opponent's placed marker with your own, creating tactical advantages or defensive plays.",
      "Grid Freeze: Briefly halt the movement or change of any dynamic grid elements in the current arena."

    "scoring_system": "Points are awarded for winning matches, completing matches within a certain time threshold, and collecting powerups. Bonus points are given for achieving a tic-tac-toe win with only a few moves.",
    "visual_style": "Clean, vector-based graphics with a strong emphasis on geometric shapes. Neon outlines and glowing elements will highlight active grid squares, player markers, and interactive environmental features. A minimalist HUD displays score, time, and available abilities.",
    "sound_theme": "Upbeat, electronic soundtrack with pulsing rhythms that increase in intensity as the round progresses. Distinct sound effects for placing markers, activating abilities, environmental shifts, and winning/losing states will provide clear audio feedback."
